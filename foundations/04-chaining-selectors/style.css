/*adding a space between the class selectors will make css want to select an element with a class of "proportioned" that is a decendant of an element with a class of "avatar"
without the space, it is selecting an element that has both classes applied to itself*/

.avatar.proportioned {
    width: 300px;
    height: auto;
}
.avatar.distorted {
    width: 200px;
